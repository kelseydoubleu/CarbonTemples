## What it does

Carbon Pulse shifts focus from individual carbon guilt to corporate accountability. The app tracks which companies users interact with throughout their day—purchases, services, brands—and displays each corporation's real-time carbon impact.

Instead of "you bought coffee, here's your personal carbon cost," it's "Starbucks emitted X tons today, here's their trajectory." The goal is to make corporate carbon impact legible and to empower consumers with information that can drive systemic change.

## Context

Developed as part of the "Carbon Capital" thesis at Columbia GSAPP, exploring how to make carbon data actionable for communities rather than individualizing climate responsibility. Carbon Pulse was designed to complement physical interventions like the Museum of Carbon by bringing carbon consciousness into everyday digital spaces.
